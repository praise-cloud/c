// source code in c, that is the general theme that programmers write that is changed into machine code (binary)

#include <stdio.h>// standard io.h, this is importing the standard.io library that gives us access to printf

int main() //
{
    char name[]= "praise";

    printf("hello, world %s\n", name); // this will print a formatted value to the terminal

    int number = 15;

    printf("hello %d", number); // $d i for number, %s is for strings etc
}
