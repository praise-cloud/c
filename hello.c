// source code in c, that is the general theme that programmers write that is changed into machine code (binary)

#include <stdio.h>// standard io.h, this is importing the standard.io library that gives us access to printf

int main() //
{
    char name[]= "praise";

    printf("hello, world %s\n", name); // this will print a formatted value to the terminal

    int number = 15;

    printf("hello, %d\n", number); // $d i for number, %s is for strings etc
    // the %s is a placeholder for the strig(it is not a data type) and the character data type

    printf("i got 100%% \n");
}
